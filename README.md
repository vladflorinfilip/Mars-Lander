# Mars-Lander

This project computes a Mars lander simulation using C++ language.

## Description 

The aim was to investigate PDI control to tune the landing parameters for a simulate dmars lander. The graphic user interface was provided and my work focused on exploring systems control to provide a reliable and safe landing mechanism.
